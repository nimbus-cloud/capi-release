libmariadb
============
This is the db connector used by the msql2 gem.

From original commit:
> We had to modify the vanilla mysql_config for
> mariadb-5.5/libmariadbclient-dev_5.5.36-1_amd64.deb to build the mysql2
> gem. We needed to replace all lib/* paths with lib/x86_64-linux-gnu or
> else the package would not compile. We stole this change from the 5.5.46
> ubuntu version. This change is in the uploaded blob.
